The task is to create a REST endpoint which given a URL, fetches an SSL certificate information
(Subject, Issuer, Validity) and outputs it as JSON.

Optional tasks (ordered by importance):
• Tests are written for the endpoint
• The REST endpoint runs as a service in Docker (or similar)
• Results are stored in a DB (which is also dockerized)
